##Find all occurrences of the given string in a character matrix
#Given an M Ã— N matrix of characters, find all occurrences of a given string in the matrix. We are allowed to search the string in all eight possible directions, i.e., North, West, South, East, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West. Note that there should not be any cycles in the output path.

    "S": [0,1],
    "SW": [-1,1],
    "W": [-1,0],
    "NW": [-1,-1]
